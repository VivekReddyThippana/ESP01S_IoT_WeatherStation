# ESP01S_IoT_WeatherStation
 ESP-01S IoT Weather Station using DHT11 &amp; ThingSpeak This project demonstrates how to use an ESP-01S Wi-Fi module to collect temperature &amp; humidity data from a DHT11 sensor, then send it to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring. The ESP-01S communicates using AT commands, making it an ideal setup for IoT-based environmental sensing.
